# Pizza Menu

This is a tutorial project from a React course in udemy by Jonas Schmedtmann designed to demonstrate react components, props and jsx. Pizza Menu by Jonas Schmedtmann: https://fast-react-pizza-menu.netlify.app/

My version is hugely based on this game: https://www.goodpizzagreatpizza.com/
I didn't come up with the name and the pizza images, and recipes are all taken from them.
